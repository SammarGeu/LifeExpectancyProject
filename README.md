Life Expectancy Prediction Project
Overview
This project is a Life Expectancy Prediction tool built in Java. It utilizes a Random Forest machine learning model to predict life expectancy based on various factors, such as socio-economic indicators, healthcare access, lifestyle habits, and more. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be applied to real-world data to analyze and predict life expectancy trends.

Features
Life Expectancy Prediction: Predict life expectancy using a trained Random Forest model.
Data Analysis: Analyze the importance of various features on life expectancy.
User Input: Accept input parameters to predict life expectancy for a given set of conditions.
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing data before training.
Visualization: Visualize the performance of the model and feature importance.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Machine Learning Library: [Use a library like Weka, Deeplearning4j, or any other Java-based ML library for Random Forest]
Libraries:
Weka (or another library for implementing the Random Forest algorithm)
JavaFX or Swing for GUI (if applicable)
Apache Commons Math for statistical calculations (optional)
